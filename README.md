### About Kiqpo

By making use of [KIQPO](https://github/kiqpo), you can build beautiful, fast, and reliable web applications without relying on [JavaScript](https://github.com/topics/javascript) frameworks, [HTML](https://github.com/topics/HTML) templates, request parsing, or state management. All of this is done using [Python](https://github.com/python) and we're targeting web, [Windows](https://github.com/microsoft), [macOS](https://github.com/topics/macos), [Linux](https://github.com/topics/linux) platforms

### Beautiful user interface

We want to enable designers to deliver their full creative vision without being forced to water it down due to limitations of the underlying framework.
that's why we follow [google](https://github.com/google)'s [material design](https://github.com/material-components) system.
